## Overview
The focus of this project is an analysis of the **Kering Group**, leveraging publicly available reports to gain insights about company's performance. The primary objective was to develop a comprehensive dashboard that investigates both financial and non-financial KPIs providing a holistic view of the performance and facilitating data-driven decision-making. 

Our unique approach emphasized evaluating the **criteria for executive bonuses**, as these align closely with the company’s overall strategic direction. By focusing on this area, the dashboard is tailored to support executives in making informed decisions.

2. **What-If Analysis**
   - Enables simulation of potential scenarios, such as changes in COGS or revenue growth.
   - Provides insights into the impact of these changes on profitability and other key metrics.

3. **Houses Page**
   - Breaks down the performance of individual brands under the Kering umbrella.
   - Displays metrics by house, year and region.
     
4. **Store Network**
   - Maps the geographical distribution of Kering’s stores and revenue by region.
   - Tracks store counts, sales channels, and revenue by product category.

5. **Market Data Page**
