## Overview
The focus of this project is an analysis of the **Kering Group**, leveraging publicly available reports to gain insights into the company's performance. The primary objective was to develop a comprehensive dashboard that investigates both **financial** and **non-financial KPIs**, providing a holistic view of the company’s performance and facilitating data-driven decision-making.

Our unique approach emphasized evaluating the **criteria for executive bonuses**, as these align closely with the company’s overall strategic direction. By focusing on this area, the dashboard is tailored to support executives in making informed decisions.


## Key Features
The dashboard is divided into several sections, providing a comprehensive analysis of the Kering Group:

1. **Analytics Overview**
   - Summarizes key financial metrics.
   - Includes visualizations of revenue and profitability trends over multiple years.

2. **What-If Analysis**
   - Simulates potential scenarios, such as changes in COGS or revenue growth.
   - Provides insights into the impact of these changes on profitability and other key metrics.

3. **Houses Page**
   - Breaks down the performance of individual brands under the Kering umbrella.
   - Displays metrics by house, year, and region.

4. **Store Network**
   - Maps the geographical distribution of Kering’s stores and revenue by region.
   - Tracks store counts, sales channels, and revenue by product category.

5. **Market Data Page**
   - Analyzes Kering’s stock performance in detail.
   - Tracks earnings per share (EPS), dividends per share (DPS), and price trends over time.

6. **Sustainability and Social Impact**
   - Highlights Kering’s efforts in reducing emissions, managing environmental risks, and promoting gender equality.
   - Includes metrics such as waste management, energy consumption, and board diversity.
